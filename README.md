# Custom Entropic Encryption Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation that modifies the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm to support entropic encryption. Below are the detailed instructions on how to set up, execute, and test the custom OpenSSL environment.

## Overview of Changes
- Custom modifications have been applied to the ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm. 
- The implementation includes enhanced logging to trace encryption and decryption processes, aiding in pinpointing specific operations within the following files:
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c`: Has a one liner `ctx->chacha.base.hw->cipher(&ctx->chacha.base, out, in, plen);` that executes encryption. It is as simple as do entropic encryption there, maintaining the parameters `out`, `in`, `plen`. Otherwise, that line of code calls a function located in `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_hw.c`
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_hw.c`: Contains a while loop that encrypts per blocks. The line of code that does the actual encryption is `ChaCha20_ctr32(out, in, blocks, ctx->key.d, ctx->counter);`. It has some logs added to check behavior. To test this algortihm, important to send long messages so that more than one block is encrypted. In case that not enough for one block data is sent, encryption happens outside the while loop. Find code in function below:
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20.h` (accessed via **default path: /path/to/your/openssl/installation**)

## Prerequisites
- Have installed library gf2x
- Have latest version of Openssl runnning. This can be done via a dockerfile, located in the server, which download this custom repository, or by download this repository into WSL. 
- Compile and build OpenSSL as per default instructions (e.g., ./Configure, make, make install)

Workflow for installing openssl - WSL
```console
git clone https://github.com/rubiogarcia465179/TLS-GF2X.git
cd TLS-GF2X/
./Configure
make clean
make
make install
```

Workflow for installing openssl and gf2x - Dockerilfe: Installing openssl does not work because gf2x is not recognized. Added comments on Openssl build commands for debugging.

```


## Running the Custom OpenSSL Environment

### Step 1: Generate Keys and Certificates
Use the following command to create RSA keys and a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=NL/ST=Nord-Brabant/L=Eindhoven/O=Localhost/CN=Localhost.com"
```

### Step 2: Start the OpenSSL Server
Run the server with the following command:
```bash
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=**/path/to/your/openssl** /path/to/your/openssl/apps/openssl s_server \
    -key key.pem \
    -cert cert.pem \
    -tls1_3 \
    -ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 \
    -accept 443
```

### Step 3: Connect the Client
Connect to the server using the OpenSSL client:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=**/path/to/your/openssl** /path/to/your/openssl/apps/openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -tls1_3
```

## To-Do List

1. **Figure out how to link the files having entropic encryption** -- `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c` -- To the openSSL build process. Not sure if this is to be done in a individual makefile that needs to be created, in ``providers\implementations\ciphers\build.info``, or `Makefile.in`. **We need to figure out this before continuing testing**
2. **Verify `gf2x` Installation**: Test the build in a Docker container (e.g., Mehmetâ€™s setup) to confirm `gf2x` is correctly installed and linked. Verify that all the code integrated into `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c` is valid. That means, function declaration, headers, includes, etc. To make things easier, all function declarations can be added directly into `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c`. If I remember well, is not the most clean approach, but can be done!
3. **Check behavior**: Test that encryption actually does something.
4. **Add decryption**: Add decryption function. Check that output is the same as input.
5. **Hybrid symmetric encryption**: If desired, we can integrate first chachapoly encryption, then over the chachapoly encrypted test, perform entropic encryption. For decrypting, inverse process.

## Notes
- **The code is integrated with chachapoly encryption algorithm. It is also quantum-resistant, but much easier to work with than AES (at least in code).**
- Extensive logging has been added to facilitate debugging and confirm where encryption and decryption operations occur in the code.
- Running this implementation in Docker might require additional setup steps; adapt these commands as needed.
- Previous instructions on OpenSSL are now added in file `README_old.md`. This makes this readme file clearer.
