# Custom Entropic Encryption Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation that modifies the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm to support entropic encryption. Below are the detailed instructions on how to set up, execute, and test the custom OpenSSL environment.

## Overview of Changes
- Custom modifications have been applied to the ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption algorithm. 
- The implementation includes enhanced logging to trace encryption and decryption processes, aiding in pinpointing specific operations within the following files:
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c`: Has a one liner `ctx->chacha.base.hw->cipher(&ctx->chacha.base, out, in, plen);` that executes encryption. It is as simple as do entropic encryption there, maintaining the parameters `out`, `in`, `plen`. Otherwise, that line of code calls a function located in `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_hw.c`
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_hw.c`: Contains a while loop that encrypts per blocks. The line of code that does the actual encryption is `ChaCha20_ctr32(out, in, blocks, ctx->key.d, ctx->counter);`. It has some logs added to check behavior. To test this algortihm, important to send long messages so that more than one block is encrypted. In case that not enough for one block data is sent, encryption happens outside the while loop. Find code in function below:
  - `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20.h` (accessed via **default path: /path/to/your/openssl/installation**)

  ```c
static int chacha20_cipher(PROV_CIPHER_CTX *bctx, unsigned char *out, const unsigned char *in, size_t inl) {
    printf("\nchacha20_cipher hw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");
    printf("\nThis function does both encryption and decryption of data\n");
    PROV_CHACHA20_CTX *ctx = (PROV_CHACHA20_CTX *)bctx;

        printf("\nEncryption happenning per blocks 1\n");
            *out++ = *in++ ^ ctx->buf[n++];
            inl--;
        }
        ctx->partial_len = n;

        ctr32 += (unsigned int)blocks;
        if (ctr32 < blocks) {

        ChaCha20_ctr32(ctx->buf, ctx->buf, CHACHA_BLK_SIZE, ctx->key.d, ctx->counter);
        printf("After ChaCha20_ctr32 for remaining bytes\n");
        for (n = 0; n < rem; n++)
            out[n] = in[n] ^ ctx->buf[n];
        ctx->partial_len = rem;
        printf("Remaining bytes: %u\n", rem);
        printf("Input: %.*s\n", rem, in);
        printf("Output: %.*s\n", rem, out);
    }

    return 1;
}
  ```

## Prerequisites
- Have installed library gf2x
- Have latest version of Openssl runnning. This can be done via a dockerfile, located in the server, which download this custom repository, or by download this repository into WSL. 
- Compile and build OpenSSL as per default instructions (e.g., ./Configure, make, make install)

## Running the Custom OpenSSL Environment

### Step 1: Generate Keys and Certificates
Use the following command to create RSA keys and a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=NL/ST=Nord-Brabant/L=Eindhoven/O=Localhost/CN=Localhost.com"
```

### Step 2: Start the OpenSSL Server
Run the server with the following command:
```bash
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=**/path/to/your/openssl** /path/to/your/openssl/apps/openssl s_server \
    -key key.pem \
    -cert cert.pem \
    -tls1_3 \
    -ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 \
    -accept 443
```

### Step 3: Connect the Client
Connect to the server using the OpenSSL client:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=**/path/to/your/openssl** /path/to/your/openssl/apps/openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -tls1_3
```

## To-Do List

1. **Figure out how to link the files having entropic encryption** -- `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c` -- To the openSSL build process. Not sure if this is to be done in a individual makefile that needs to be created, in ``providers\implementations\ciphers\build.info``, or `Makefile.in`. **We need to figure out this before continuing testing**
2. **Verify `gf2x` Installation**: Test the build in a Docker container (e.g., Mehmetâ€™s setup) to confirm `gf2x` is correctly installed and linked. Verify that all the code integrated into `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c` is valid. That means, function declaration, headers, includes, etc. To make things easier, all function declarations can be added directly into `providers/implementations/ciphers/cipher_chacha20_poly1305_hw.c`. If I remember well, is not the most clean approach, but can be done!
3. **Check behavior**: Test that encryption actually does something.
4. **Add decryption**: Add decryption function. Check that output is the same as input.
5. **Hybrid symmetric encryption**: If desired, we can integrate first chachapoly encryption, then over the chachapoly encrypted test, perform entropic encryption. For decrypting, inverse process.

## Notes
- **The code is integrated with chachapoly encryption algorithm. It is also quantum-resistant, but much easier to work with than AES (at least in code).**
- Extensive logging has been added to facilitate debugging and confirm where encryption and decryption operations occur in the code.
- Running this implementation in Docker might require additional setup steps; adapt these commands as needed.

OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit
for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only)
protocols.

The protocol implementations are based on a full-strength general purpose
cryptographic library, which can also be used stand-alone. Also included is a
cryptographic module validated to conform with FIPS standards.

OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
and Tim J. Hudson.

The official Home Page of the OpenSSL Project is [www.openssl.org].

Overview
========

The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

- **libssl**
  an implementation of all TLS protocol versions up to TLSv1.3 ([RFC 8446]),
  DTLS protocol versions up to DTLSv1.2 ([RFC 6347]) and
  the QUIC (currently client side only) version 1 protocol ([RFC 9000]).

- **libcrypto**
  a full-strength general purpose cryptographic library. It constitutes the
  basis of the TLS implementation, but can also be used independently.

- **openssl**
  the OpenSSL command line tool, a swiss army knife for cryptographic tasks,
  testing and analyzing. It can be used for
  - creation of key parameters
  - creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
  - calculation of message digests
  - encryption and decryption
  - SSL/TLS/DTLS and client and server tests
  - QUIC client tests
  - handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
  - and more...

Download
========

For Production Use
------------------

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
[www.openssl.org/source](https://www.openssl.org/source).
The OpenSSL project does not distribute the toolkit in binary form.

However, for a large variety of operating systems precompiled versions
of the OpenSSL toolkit are available. In particular, on Linux and other
Unix operating systems, it is normally recommended to link against the
precompiled shared libraries provided by the distributor or vendor.

We also maintain a list of third parties that produce OpenSSL binaries for
various Operating Systems (including Windows) on the [Binaries] page on our
wiki.

For Testing and Development
---------------------------

Although testing and development could in theory also be done using
the source tarballs, having a local copy of the git repository with
the entire project history gives you much more insight into the
code base.

The official OpenSSL Git Repository is located at [git.openssl.org].
There is a GitHub mirror of the repository at [github.com/openssl/openssl],
which is updated automatically from the former on every commit.

A local copy of the Git Repository can be obtained by cloning it from
the original OpenSSL repository using

    git clone git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git

or from the GitHub mirror using

    git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git

If you intend to contribute to OpenSSL, either to fix bugs or contribute
new features, you need to fork the OpenSSL repository openssl/openssl on
GitHub and clone your public fork instead.

    git clone https://github.com/yourname/openssl.git

This is necessary because all development of OpenSSL nowadays is done via
GitHub pull requests. For more details, see [Contributing](#contributing).

Build and Install
=================

After obtaining the Source, have a look at the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file for
detailed instructions about building and installing OpenSSL. For some
platforms, the installation instructions are amended by a platform specific
document.
